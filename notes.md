It's the main topic in this module.

## Semantic Web project and Big Data Systems
SW == Semantic Web

The SW prj was announced in 2001 by W3C.
The principal objective was as follows: to make the content of web pages readable not only by people but also by computer intelligent agents (aka CIA). 
So CIA'll be able to use the content of web pages and other web-based resources for solving the tasks formulated by the users.
The second objective was to considerably improve the preconditions of semantic (aka conceptual) information retrieval on the Web.
The central idea was to reach these objectives mainly with the help of 
- new semantically structured informational languages
- a rich family (to be developed!) of antologies (distributed knowledge bases) storing knoledge from numerous application domains

This task statements based on th results obtained during the preliminary stage of SW process (second half of the 1990s).
These results are:
- resource description framework (RDF) - it is interpreted as the simpliest information language for developing distributed databases and knowledge banks.

The main data structure of RDF is triples of the form (A, B, C) where 
- A is subject
- B is predicate
- C is object
